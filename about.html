    <h2>1. About The Curated Vintage Jewelry</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>The Curated Vintage Jewelry</strong> is an online boutique specializing in carefully selected
      vintage and curated jewelry. Each item is chosen individually for its character, craftsmanship,
      and timeless appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      We operate on a small-batch, curated model. Most items available in our store are one of a kind
      or available in extremely limited quantities. Once sold, items are unlikely to be restocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the nature of vintage jewelry, minor signs of age, wear, or patina may be present.
      These characteristics are part of the item’s history and uniqueness and are not considered defects.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Nature of Products</h2>
    <p>
      All products sold by The Curated Vintage Jewelry are vintage or curated items.
      As such, they may differ from modern, mass-produced jewelry.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Variations in color, texture, or finish may occur</li>
      <li>Measurements are provided to the best of our ability but may vary slightly</li>
      <li>Screen settings may affect color representation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By placing an order, you acknowledge and accept the nature of vintage products.
    </p>
