    <h2>1. General Policy</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>The Curated Vintage Jewelry</strong>, each item is carefully selected and often one of a kind.
      Due to the nature of vintage jewelry and our curated business model, all purchases are handled individually
      and with particular attention to detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, <strong>all sales are considered final</strong>, except as expressly stated in this policy.
      We encourage customers to review product descriptions, measurements, and images carefully and to contact us
      with any questions prior to placing an order.
